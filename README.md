Install Required Gems:
Make sure you have the selenium-webdriver gem installed. If not, you can install it using:

gem install selenium-webdriver

Install Chrome WebDriver:
You'll also need the WebDriver for Google Chrome, which allows Selenium to control a Chrome browser instance. You can download the appropriate WebDriver for your Chrome version from the official website: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/

After downloading the WebDriver, place it in a directory that's included in your system's PATH.
